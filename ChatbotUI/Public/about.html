             <h3 style="color:black">DETAILS ABOUT FOODY CHATBOT:</h3>
	     <p style="color:black"> This chatbot was created from five students for a project in the course EPL 361 - Software Engineering with the
	      corporation of Foody Org. The purpose of this project was to learn how to build from scratch a software and how we communicate with
	      many people in large projects.
	     </p>
	     <p style="color:black">The first function of Foody Chatbot is that you can search for the nearest restaurants based on 
	      the food you want to eat and your postal code. 
              The second function is that multiple users can use it the same time without any problem. Each user has a unique
	      token, working as a unique code per user. 
	      We are planning to add more functions for Foody Chatbot in the near future.
